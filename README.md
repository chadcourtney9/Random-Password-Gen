# Random-Password-Gen
#### For this project I was tasked with creating a random password generator. This generator allows to you have a password created from 8 characters all the way up to 128! There are 4 boxes to be selected, lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters. Lower case is disabled and checked to insure that you will always get a password! You can mix and match whichever boxes you prefer to have in! A reason randomized passwords are great is it is much harder for people to be able to guess their way into your accounts!
